Introduction
What was the task? (Task overview)
	-- research question
Why do I do that? (Motivation)
	-- what were the reasons for approaching this task?

What kind of research was previously done in the field?
	-- TensorFlow
	-- ObjectDetection API
	-- Colab laboratory
	-- tutorials for custom object detection

How I decided to approach the task?
	-- collect images for custom dataset 
		(1 gesture - 50 pics) - 100 steps
		(2 gestures - 50 pics each) - 100 steps
		(3 gestures - 50 pics each) - 100 steps
		(3 gestures - 100 pics each) - 100/200/300 steps
		(5 gestures - 100 pics each) - 300/500 steps (optional)

	-- label the images with specific classes
	-- train a custom object classifier using TensorFlow object detection API
	-- get a frozen graph and convert it in lite version to use in mobile apps
	-- demonstrate the inference results in Android app (how model works)
	
How did I plan to evaluate the results?
	-- conduct set of experiments
	-- accuracy/loss/confidence/timing
	-- benchmark review with different models

What did I build?
	--What I did at the foundation stage? (50 pics for 3 sign)
	--dataset + labels -> train/test records + pipleline config + pretrained model -> custom model
	--What I did at the further stage(s)?

Where did I struggle?
	--difficulties/challenges
	--performance issues/overfitting/conversion, exporting issues/launch on mobile device 

What outcomes(end product) did I get?
	--frozen graph
	--Dlite model for inference 

How  does it work?
	--tensors
	--train a pertained model from TensorFlow Zoo
	--custom object detection with specific dataset

What is the Computing aspect of the project?
	-- putting everything into cloud
	-- converting original model into lite format
	-- finding the optimal pretained model from the TensorFlow Zoo

What are the future directions of this work?
	-- data crawlers
	-- data augmentation
	-- js version of model

How do I demonstrate the results? 
	-- Android application demo
